**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/lifekeeper/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/lifekeeper/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/lifekeeper/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add Activity1")`
 API call.<br>

### Model component

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/lifekeeper/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Lifekeeper data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/lifekeeper/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Lifekeeper data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.lifekeeper.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.lifekeeper.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.lifekeeper.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.lifekeeper.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Lifekeeper depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix A User Stories

## Appendix B Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Lifekeeper` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)
#### Use case: Delete task

**MSS**

Prerequisite steps:
1. User requests to add task that (s)he wishes to add <br>


Preconditions:
-

1. User add the task with desirable parameters
2. Lifekeeper updates the storage of the adding of task
3. Lifekeeper displays added tasks in the App <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. User keys in invalid parameters

> 1a1. Lifekeeper gives an error message and returns an empty Command Box
  Use case resumes at step 1

1b. User does not want to add any task

> 1b1. User types in `undo` to go back to previous menu
  Use case ends

2a. Lifekeeper has exact same task existed in the storage file

> 2a1. Lifekeeper gives an error message and returns an empty Command Box
  Use case resumes at step 1


#### Use case: Delete task

**MSS**

Prerequisite steps:
1. User requests to search for task that (s)he wishes to delete <br>
2. Lifekeeper shows an indexed list of tasks that matches the search <br>

Preconditions:
Lifekeeper has returned an indexed list of tasks that matches the search

1. User finds the index of the task (s)he wants to delete and enters the index of the task to be deleted
2. Lifekeeper deletes the task, shows an acknowledgement message to user. <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. User cannot find the index of the task that (s)he wants to delete

> 1a1. User types in command to go back to the previous menu. <br>
  Users repeats the prerequisite steps 1-2. <br>
  Use case ends

1b. User does not want to delete any task

> 1b1. User types in command to go back to previous menu
  Use case ends

1c. User keys in invalid index

> 1c1. Lifekeeper gives an error message and returns an empty Command Box
  Use case resumes at step 1

#### Use case: Edit task

**MSS**

Prerequisite steps:
1. User requests to search for task that (s)he wishes to edit
2. Lifekeeper shows an indexed list of tasks that matches the search
3. User selects the correct task that (s)he wants to edit by entering the index of task

Preconditions:
User has already selected the task that (s)he wants to edit.

Editing steps:
1. Lifekeeper will return the Task with its corresponding parameters onto the CLI for users to directly edit.<br>
2. User will edit the Task parameters directly through the CLI, or add new parameters through the CLI <br>
3. Lifekeeper will update the Task parameters accordingly, and then show the updated Task and its parameters to the user.<br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. Parameters input by user is invalid

> 2a1. Lifekeeper shows the relevant error message to user (depending on the error found by Lifekeeper).<br>
> 2a2. Lifekeeper return the Task with its corresponding parameters onto the CLI for users to directly edit, and highlights the parameter that is causing the error<br>
> 2a3. User makes edits the parameters by changing the words on the CLI<br>
Repeat steps 2a1-2a3 until Lifekeeper judges that the input parameters are all valid
Use case resumes from step 3.
