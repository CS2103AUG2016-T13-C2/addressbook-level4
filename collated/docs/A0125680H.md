**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Lifekeeper data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Lifekeeper data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Lifekeeper depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix A : User Stories
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
Finding all activities containing a certain tag    
* Finds activities which has tags of given keywords attached to it.<br>    
* Format: `find tags KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`   
    
> * The search is not case sensitive.     
> * Only full words will be matched.    
> * Only tags matching the EXACT keyword will be returned.    
    
Examples:   
* `find CS2103`    
  Returns Any activities containing the tag `CS2103` or `cs2103` but not `CS2103T` or `CS2103 Project`.    

#### Deleting an activity: `delete`
Deletes the selected activity from Lifekeeper. Irreversible.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX`

> Deletes the activity with `INDEX`. 
  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
  

Examples: 
* `list`<br>
  `delete 1`<br>
  Deletes the 1st activity in the Lifekeeper activity list.
* `find Dinner`<br>
  `delete 2`<br>
  Deletes the 2nd activity listed in the results of the `find` command.

#### Marking an activity as done: `done`
Marks the activity as completed.<br>
Format: `done INDEX`

> Marks the activity with `INDEX` as completed.
  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
  

Examples: 
* `list`<br>
  `done 1`<br>
  Marks the 1st activity in the Lifekeeper activity list as completed.
* `find Admin`<br>
  `done 2`<br>
  Selects the 2nd activity in the results of the `find` command and then marks it as completed.

```
###### \UserGuide.md

#### Editing an activity: `edit`
Edits the selected activity from Lifekeeper.<br>
Format: `edit INDEX [n/ACTIVITY_NAME] {[d/DUEDATE] [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL]}{[s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME]} [r/REMINDER] [t/TAG]...` 

> Edits the activity that was previously selected with `INDEX`. 
  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
  

Examples: 
* `list`<br>
  `edit 2 n/assignment 5 r/today`<br>
  Edit the selected the 2nd activity in the list by changing its name to `assignment 5` and reminder to `today`.
* `find CS2103 Assignment`<br>
  `edit 1 d/15-06-2017`<br>
  Selects the 1st activity in the results of the `find` command and then change the DUEDATE to `15/06/2017`.

#### Undoing an action : `undo`
Reverts the action that was previously executed.<br>
Format: `undo`

#### Clearing all entries : `clear`
Clears all entries from Lifekeeper.<br>
Format: `clear`  

#### Exiting the program : `exit`
Exits the program.<br>
Format: `exit`  

#### Saving the data 
Lifekeeper data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.<br>
There is no need to save manually.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with 
       the file that contains the data of your previous Lifekeeper folder.
